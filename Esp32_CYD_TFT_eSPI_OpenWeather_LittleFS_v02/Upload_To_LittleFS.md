  For uploading the files to LittleFS use the arduino-littlefs-upload plugin:

  https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload
  
  Description: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp32-littlefs/
  
  Place it in this folder: C:\Users\Arduino3\.arduinoIDE\plugins (create it...)
  
  To check if the plugin was successfully installed, press [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [P] to open 
  the command palette. An instruction called 'Upload Little FS to Pico/ESP8266/ESP32' 
  should be there (just scroll down or search for the name of the instruction).
  
  The upload is starting directly.
